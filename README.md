## About

Anti-phishing educational tools contribute to long-term recognition and knowledge retention of phishing attacks [1]. With a substantial increase in phishing attacks every year [2], more anti-phishing platforms should be made available on the web for individuals and organizations to better protect themselves. Drawing on research evidence about the effectiveness of anti-phishing training [3] and quiz based evaluation methods [4, 5], I created an open source online platform aimed to help educate users about phishing attacks. The platform allows users to quickly learn about what phishing is, the stages in a phishing attack, the common types of phishing, and how to prevent a phishing attack. The platform also allows users to test their understanding by taking a short quiz. The quiz presents a series of screenshots of phishing and legitimate emails and the user must verify their authenticity. The limitations of this platform welcome the opportunity for developers and researchers to contribute to addressing its shortcomings.
