## About

There are many online tools and resources for learning about phishing; however, people continue to fall victim to phishing attacks every year [2]. In _Don’t click: towards an effective anti-phishing training. A comparative literature review_, a paper by Daniel Jampen, Gürkan Gür, Thomas Sutter, and Bernhard Tellenbach, it was discovered that educational tools about phishing are only a limited subset of what is necessary for long-term recognition of phishing attacks [1]. In order to help satisfy this subset of necessities for long-term recognition, more anti-phishing material should be made available on the web. The goal of this project is to contribute to the number of anti-phishing educational tools currently available on the internet. phishEd provides a quick and easy way for people to learn about phishing and how they can keep their personal information safe from cybercriminals.
